# BitNode 1 Roadmap

This roadmap outlines my progression through **BitNode 1 (levels 1â€“3)**.  
Each stage ties directly to the scripts and guides in this repo, showing what to run, what to buy, and what the overall goal is.

## 1. Hacknet Bootstrap
- **Script:** `hackcome.js`

## 3. Server Access & Backdoors
- **Script:** `openSesame.js`  
- **Workflow:** Run the script to open ports, then manually `connect` + `backdoor`.  
- **Key Targets:** `CSEC`, later `avmnite-02h`, `I.I.I.I`, `run4theh111z`, `w0r1d_d43m0n`.  
- **Why:** Root and backdoors are required for faction access and storyline progress.

## 4. Hacking Level 200 Servers
- **Script:** `opti200.js`  
- **Goal:** Hack servers up to level 200.  
- **Why:** Provides XP and reliable money while infrastructure builds.  

---

## 5. Dark Web â€” Full Buildout
- **Buy:** Remaining programs.  
- **Must-have:** `Formulas.exe`.  
- **Why:** Unlocks advanced calculations, essential for efficient hacking and stock trading.  

---

## 6. Stock Market Automation
- **Script:** `AgentOrange.js`

  - `PBweak1`, `PBweak2`  
  - `PBgrow1`, `PBgrow2`  
  - `PBhack1`, `PBhack2`  
- **Why:** Provides RAM backbone for running optimized and smart hack loops.  

---

## 8. Hacking Level 600+ Servers
- **Scripts:** `smart200.js`, `smart600.js`  
- **Goal:** Target midgame servers at level 600.  
- **Why:** Stronger income and XP scaling.  

---

## 9. Hacking Level 1000â€“1500 Servers

## ðŸ”® Endgame â€” Augmentations & Daemon
- **Goal:** Buy augmentations in cycles, install, and reset.
