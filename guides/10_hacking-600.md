# Hacking Level 600 Servers

**Scripts:** `smart200.js`, `smart600.js`  
**Purpose:** Transition into midgame hacking using smarter scripts on level 600 servers.  

---

## Notes
- Builds on the 200-level hacks with more efficient batching.  
- Requires stronger RAM infrastructure (purchased servers).  
- Provides the income needed to unlock level 1000+ targets.  

---

## TODO
- Add recommended target list for 600-level servers.  
- Document differences between `smart200.js` and `smart600.js`.
