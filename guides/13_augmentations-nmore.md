# Augmentations & World Daemon

**Goal:** Buy augmentations, install, reset, and prepare for the World Daemon.  

---

## Notes
- Prioritize hacking multipliers early.  
- Always buy `NeuroFlux Governor` as reputation/money allow.  
- Each reset makes subsequent BN1 runs faster.  
- Final objective: hack `w0r1d_d43m0n` to complete BN1.  

---

## TODO
- Add recommended augmentation purchase order.  
- Document required reputation thresholds for key factions.  
- Add checklist for World Daemon prep.
