# Server Fleet Expansion

**Script:** `getEveryone.js`  
**Purpose:** Buys 6 max-size servers to host hacking scripts.  

---

## Server Names
- `PBweak1`, `PBweak2`  
- `PBgrow1`, `PBgrow2`  
- `PBhack1`, `PBhack2`  

---

## Notes
- Distributes `opti` and `smart` scripts across dedicated servers.  
- Provides backbone RAM for scaling to higher-level hacking.  
- Core step before moving into 600+ servers.  

---

## TODO
- Add server cost breakdown at max RAM.  
- Example: calculate cost for 6 servers at current maximum size.
