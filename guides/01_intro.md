# Introduction

Welcome to the **BitBurner BN1 Playbook**.  
This project documents my path through **BitNode 1 (levels 1–3)** using a set of scripts and guides.  
It’s both a **personal learning log** and a **public resource** for other players.

---

## Purpose
- Practice writing **clean scripts** with inline documentation.  
- Learn **good GitHub documentation habits** by pairing code with guides.  
- Provide a **step-by-step roadmap** for defeating BN1.  
- Track my own progress and decisions so I can look back later.

---

## What You’ll Find
- **/scripts** — Netscript `.js` files (automating hacking, stock trading, etc.)  
- **/guides** — Markdown notes that explain strategies, milestones, and why certain scripts exist  
- **/assets** — Visuals like diagrams or screenshots (future)  

---

## Audience
This repo is for:
- New players who want a structured BN1 path.  
- Myself (future me) when I forget why I wrote something the way I did.  
- Anyone curious about mixing **gameplay + documentation practices**.

---

## Next Steps
- Start with the **BN1 Roadmap** (`02_bn1-roadmap.md`) to see the big picture.  
- Explore individual guides for topics like Hacknet scaling and stock trading.  
- Dig into the scripts with inline docs for details on how each one works.
